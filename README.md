# Piano-Box
This repostory will include the content of my first Arduino-Processing project.

Here's a photo of the Arduino circuit so you can do it yourself.

***Material you need:***
  - 20 cables (length doesn't matter)
  - 8 220Ohm resistors
  - 8 buttons
  - 1 piezo
  - Protoboard (size doesn't matter)
  - Arduino R3 or any arduino that can accept at least 8 digital pins and a GND pin with a 5V

**Important:**
  - If you are gonna use a battery instead of the USB cable, I recommend you to use a 9V. Just in case this is too much for any battery.
  - If you want to make a video tutorial about this arduino circuit (I don't have intended to do a video tutorial for this, for now...), tell me!!!
  - Have fun!

# The project
This project is based on a Arduino circuit that imitates the carecteristics of a piano and if it's connected to my processing sketch it can also act as a macro for your computer and toggle between music and macro configuration.

This project will be updated, I'm trying my best to make a really good project so people can enjoy it. For now, ~~you can assign any key to the buttons,~~ in the future I will make a configuartion for the music.

# The files
For now the project is not done.

But here's the files if someone wants to see them.
