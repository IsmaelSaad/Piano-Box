# Piano-Box
This repostory will include the content of my first Arduino-Processing project.

Here's a photo of the circuit so you can do it yourself.

***Material you need:***
  - 27 cables (10 short sized, 8 medium sized and 7 large sized)
  - 8 220Ohm resistors
  - 8 buttons
  - 1 potentiometer
  - 1 piezo
  - 2 Protoboards (atleast 1 that is large)
  - An ESP32-WROOM-32
  - 1 USB mini cable

**Important:**
  - If you want to make a video tutorial about this arduino circuit (I don't have intended to do a video tutorial for this, for now...), tell me!!!
  - Have fun!

# The project
This is a recreation of a small piano with 8 keys, a potentiometer controls the pitch. I used the Arduino IDE for this.
